# Draft LinkedIn Post

Write a LinkedIn post that earns attention and drives action. No filler, no corporate speak, no engagement bait.

## Inputs

Ask for these if not provided:

- **Topic**: What the post is about. A specific insight, experience, or position works better than a broad theme.
- **Audience**: Who should care. Job title, industry, or situation (e.g., "engineering managers dealing with reorgs", "founders raising Series A").
- **Goal**: What the post should accomplish. Share a lesson, spark discussion, drive traffic, build credibility on a topic, etc.

## Process

1. Confirm topic, audience, and goal. Ask clarifying questions if any are vague.
2. Identify the core insight. Every good LinkedIn post has exactly one. If you can't state it in a sentence, the topic needs narrowing.
3. Write the post following the structure and voice guidelines below.
4. Present the draft for review. Offer specific options: "Want me to sharpen the hook?", "Should the CTA be softer?", etc.

## Post Structure

LinkedIn rewards posts that are easy to scan on mobile. Structure accordingly.

**Hook (first 1-2 lines)**: This is the only part most people see before "...see more." It must create enough tension, curiosity, or recognition to earn the click. Lead with the sharpest version of your insight, not background. No throat-clearing.

Effective hooks:
- A counterintuitive claim ("The best engineers I've managed were the slowest coders.")
- A specific, concrete moment ("Last Tuesday I sat in a meeting where someone said 'we just need to execute better.' I almost lost it.")
- A direct challenge ("If your 1:1s are status updates, you're wasting everyone's time.")

Weak hooks:
- Starting with "I've been thinking about..." (you're burying the lede)
- Rhetorical questions with obvious answers ("Do you struggle with time management?")
- Generic motivation ("In today's fast-paced world...")

**Body (3-8 short paragraphs or a mix of paragraphs and bullets)**: Deliver on the hook's promise. Use line breaks between paragraphs for scannability. Each paragraph should be 1-3 sentences. If a paragraph is longer, break it up or cut it.

- Use concrete examples over abstract principles
- One idea per paragraph
- If listing items, use bullets or numbered lists
- Bold key phrases sparingly for emphasis (LinkedIn supports **bold** via Unicode)

**Close (1-2 lines)**: End with a call to action matched to the goal:
- Discussion: Ask a specific question (not "thoughts?")
- Credibility: Summarize the takeaway in one sentence
- Traffic: Link in first comment (mention this), with a reason to click

## Voice Guidelines

Write like a peer sharing hard-won insight, not a thought leader performing expertise.

**Do:**
- Use first person and specific details
- Name decisions, trade-offs, and what you learned
- Be direct about what worked and what didn't
- Write sentences you'd actually say to a colleague

**Don't:**
- Use "leverage", "synergy", "unlock", "game-changer", or similar corporate filler
- Add inspirational closers ("And that's the power of...")
- Pad with qualifiers ("I think maybe potentially...")
- Write in the third person about yourself
- Use em-dashes

## Formatting Notes

- LinkedIn renders line breaks as typed. Single blank line between paragraphs.
- No markdown rendering (no headers, no links in body, no images inline). Bold/italic via Unicode characters only.
- Hashtags: 3-5 relevant ones at the end, max. They go after the CTA, not inline.
- Character limit: ~3,000 for posts. Aim for 800-1,500 for most posts. Longer is fine if the content earns the length.
- Mentions (@Name) boost reach when relevant. Don't force them.

## Output

Present the draft as a single text block, ready to paste into LinkedIn. Follow it with a brief note on what choices you made and why, so the author can evaluate them.
